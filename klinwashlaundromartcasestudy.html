                        <p>
                            <br>Mr John never taught he would run a laundry service because he never imagined that his current income at his present firm wont be able to cover his needs. So she decided to start a laundry service to serve him a residual source of income while he retains his current Job. He got a location at a university with a  population of about 50,000 students, a large majority of whom do not have the time to wash their clothes or perhaps find it tedious to do their laundry. Everything seemed right to John a large student population and he could identify a need his laundry service was going to solve, so he started Klin Wash Laundro Mart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weeks and Months went by and klinwash Laundro mart never meet its sales target to deliver MrJohn a reasonable level of income. He noticed that he identified the right customer problem, students needed someone to wash their clothes for them but he later noticed that students never wanted this problem solved despite the fact they had them. In order to run a further probe klinwash Laundro mart offered a free washing service for 2 days and the queue at his business location was longer than a bridge. After this free service he was able to validate that students actually wanted somebody to wash their clothes for them but were not ready to pay his price to have their clothes washed. He also knew he could not afford to run another free service if he still wanted to stay in business.
                            <br>
                            He decided to use Free App’s promo listing but was scared that reducing his price further might plunge him into more loss. But his courage paid off following this metrics and he had a magical increase in sales.

                            <br>
                            <div class="post-thumb">

                                    <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></a>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                            <br>
                            This is exactly why the magic happened.
                            <br>
                            1.Mr John’s laundry space rent was fixed at (N50), whether he washed for 10 students or a 100 students, his staff salary and electricity bills were also fixed whether he made high sales or not. Free App leveraged on these fixed costs to improve his sales, by making sure he had a promo price that attracted more students so he could make more money with the same resources (rent, salary and electricity bill) he used to make less all for a promo price.
                            <br>Promo prices improved his sales because students could now afford his solution to their problem. He initially had a profit of N10 on each piece of laundry but with a promo price his profit was pegged at N8. His total annual sale before he subscribed to Free App was 3,600 but his sales increased to 7000. It would have taken him an extra 1yr shop space rent, 12 months staff salary and 12 months electricity bill to hit 7000 sales if he was still selling for his old price and the N2 difference between his former profit margin and his current one will not be enough to cover this additional cost. 
                            <br>So his subscription to Free App promo code and product advert helped him hit his sales target.
